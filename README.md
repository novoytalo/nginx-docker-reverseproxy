# nginx-docker-reverseproxy

This is basic implementation of reverse proxy using nginx on docker. 
This is used for connect redirect calls to api and avoid errors about 
comunication without an online server from frontend to backend. 
Load balance or aplications maybe can be done on the future usin this base...

# Using 
Make sure you have docker and docker-compose and run: docker-compose up --build
If you don't have a endpoint called "grandetabela" you can use www.google.com as exemple
You need only uncomment it.
